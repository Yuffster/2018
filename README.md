# 2018 Ruby for Good Projects

### Diaperbase (brownfield project, inventory management)
Each month over 350,000 children are helped by diaper banks, forgoing their parents having to make the difficult choice of choosing between feeding their children and putting diapers on them. There are diaper banks in 44 states and they provide about 4 million diapers a month to needy families. We're going to be using the SaaS that we built last year, making it more robust, and polishing it off to be demoed at the National Diaperbank Network conference later this year. Our goal is for this one to be the best Inventory management product available at the lowest (or "no") cost to diaperbanks. We will be working in tandem with PartnerBase, which is a CRM for Community Partners that will work with the Diaperbanks to handle distribution / order fulfillment /family interaction.

### Diaper Partner

Diaper Partner is a CRM tool designed to help diaper bank partners get diapers to those in need efficiently. Diaper partners are the public facing side of the diaper bank pipeline. As such, diaper partners need an effective way to track diapers from diaper bank all the way through to child recipient and be able to report back to diaper banks.

Weâ€™ll be building a multi-tenant system to allow approved diaper bank partners to track their clients (children), fill diaper orders, distribute diaper donations, and report on crucial data points. Diaper Partner will work in tandem with DiaperBase to complement its diaper bank inventory tracking and order fullfillment system via APIs.

We're lucky to have Megan Fischer with us as our on-site stakeholder and diaper bank guru this year. She runs the Sweet Cheeks Diaper Bank (SCDB) in Cincinnati, OH. SCDB is also a member of the National Diaper Bank Network. Megan started SCDB in late 2015 and has grown to distributing over 50K diapers per month.

We'll be partnering with Sweet Cheeks Diaper Bank as well as PDX Diaper Bank to test our Diaper Partner system.

### New Sanctuary Coalition

The New Sanctuary Coalition is a network of congregations, organizations, and individuals standing publicly in solidarity with families and communities resisting detention and deportation. NSC's accompaniment program pairs undocumented people with a group of trained volunteers to accompany them to their immigration hearings and check-ins with ICE. NSC holds pro-se clinics, where undocumented people work with trained volunteers and lawyers to prepare documents (asylum applications, juvenile visas, etc.) to fight their immigration case.  NSC works with detained immigrants across the US and their families to fight for their release.  We'll be working on the internal database software that facilitates these (and more) NSC programs and allows them to operate at increasing scale.
